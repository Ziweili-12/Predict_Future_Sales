## Project Description
In this project, we have tried different models such as
* XGBoost
* LGM
* Linear Regression
* LASSO Regression
* Ridge Regression
* Elastic Net Regression
* Random Forest
* Time Series

We have employed 21 features in our model and selected them according to the feature performance.
We had also tried to convert the categorical data columns into binary ones by one-hot-encoding for better model performance.
According to the result we got from Time Series Analysis, we selected the best part of data, which is the most recent six months data to train our models.
